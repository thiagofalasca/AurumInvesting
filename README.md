# AurumInvesting

The project was developed in a group and aims to be a comprehensive web-based investment management platform. Users can register their investments in stocks, fixed income, and checking accounts, and track their performance through graphs and metrics.

The application has its limitations due to the weak capabilities of some used free versions of APIs.

All project diagrams and documents were developed, and the team utilized Scrum as the development methodology.

The project was built using Java programming language with SpringBoot for the backend, and JavaScript with ReactJs for the frontend, along with HTML and CSS for markup and styling, respectively.

We integrated the application with the financial market using the Yahoo Finance API to perform calculations and retrieve necessary data.
